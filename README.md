# EnergyFlo
Cleveland State University
CIS 470 Final Project
Spring 2017

Idea:
Energyflo is a personal-productivity optimizer.

Our bodily energy levels are not static, but change throughout the day. Labeling ourselves as an "early bird" or "night owl" is of limited help in day-planning.

By observing and recording our energy levels at regular intervals over a number of days, we can begin to identify times of peak-energy. This in turn allows us to prioritize our most important work for our most productive hours of the day.

App features:
  • Simple user-interface for data input
  • Notifications reminding the user to record their current energy level
  • Graph showing average energy levels for each hour of the day
  • Notifications notifying users that they are about to enter a peak energy period and should plan to do their most important tasks
